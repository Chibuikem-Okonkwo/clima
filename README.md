# Clima ☁

## The Goal

The objective of this project is to learn about asynchronous programming in Dart. It carries time consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet. 


## What was made

I made a weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-). I was able to find out the live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city you can think of by using the GeoLocator package to get live locaton and consuming the OpenWeatherMap API
